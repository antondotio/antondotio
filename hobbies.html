                    The main thing I do these days, which I picked up during the beginning of quarantine, is stream on
                    Twitch. I
                    just stream me playing
                    several games and hang out with some friends. I stream about twice a week, this is something I do
                    just
                    as a fun
                    thing, nothing that I would do full time. Of course, with streaming also means that I play a lot of
                    video games,
                    just like most college students.

            <h2>Baking</h2>
            <p>
                Another hobby I picked up during quarantine was baking. I really enjoy it and my specialty is Red Velvet
                Crinkles. Although it is very time consuming, it's really warding when it comes out delicious!

            <h2>Other Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                Something that I like to do when I have nothing to do is draw, and more specifically, digital art. But
                other
                than that, one thing I always do when at home is watch different shows and movies. My favorite genre is
                definitely horror. Something that I definitely want to get into is sewing.
