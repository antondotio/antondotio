        <h1>Hey there!</h1>
        <h3>I'm Antonio, a Junior Software Engineer.</h3>
        <p>
          I am a current employee of <b>Phreesia</b> as a <b>Software Engineer</b>, but have had experience as a <b>Backend Software Developer Intern</b> at <b>Chata Technologies</b>.
          I graduated from the <b>University of Calgary</b> in Alberta, Canada with a Bachelor's Degree in <b>Software Engineering</b>. 
          I am currently based in Calgary, but it's my goal to live and work in New York City. (And I plan on making this happen soon!)
          It's always been my dream to move to a big city, and New York is just perfect for me.
          <br><br>My most notable skills lie in Backend Development as that's where I've had the most experience; my favorite languages being <b>Javascript, Python, and Java</b>
          But being relatively new to the industry, I don't want to box myself in just yet! I want to explore everything that the programming world has to offer. 
          <br><br>In my spare time, I like to watch movies (my favorite is Howl's Moving Castle) and shows , play video games, or listen to music, these helps me relax and destress. 
          I also love traveling, baking, drawing and, of course, coding!

            I graduated from the University of Calgary in May 2022 and received my degree in Software Engineering from
            the Sculich School of Engineering. I first discovered my interest in programming during my first
            year of university. In the first year of engineering, every student must take an intro class for
            every engineering specialization, and when I took the intro programming class, I instantly fell in
            love with it and knew it was what I wanted to study and learn.
