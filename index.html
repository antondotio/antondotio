        <h1> Hey there!</h1>
        <p>
          Nice to meet you! I am Antonio Santos, but you can just call me Anton. I'm a Software Engineering Student at the University of
          Calgary, in Canada. I
          am a few months away
          from graduating and finally getting my iron ring and I could not be more excited! It's my dream to live and work in New York City. I have always wanted to live in a big city and when I visited New York in the Summer of 2021,
          I
          just knew that's where I wanted to be. I love to travel, bake, learn about fashion and, of course, code!

            Calgary,Alberta,Canada<br>
            September 2017 - June 2022</b><br><br>
            I am currently a 4th year student at the University of Calgary. I major in Software Engineering at
            the Sculich Schoool of Engineering. I first discovered my interest in programming during my first
            year of university. In the first year of engineering, every student must take an intro class for
            every engineering specialization, and when I took the intro programming class, I instantly fell in
            love with it and knew it was what I wanted to do.

        project, the Recommendation Engine for recommending the flights, the Tracking Engine to track the
        customer's past flights and the Vue component to display the information. This is currently a work in
        progress.
