        <h1>Hey there!</h1>
        <h3>I'm Antonio, a Junior Software Developer.</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a <b>Software Engineering</b> Student at the <b>University of
          Calgary</b> in Alberta, Canada. I am a few months away
          from graduating and finally getting my iron ring and I could not be more excited! 
          It's my dream to live and work in New York City. 
          I have always wanted to live in a big city and when I visited New York in the Summer of 2021, I
          just knew that's where I wanted to be. 
          <br>In my spare time, I like to watch movies/shows, play video games, or listen to music, these helps me relax and destress. 
          I also love traveling, baking, drawing and, of course, coding!

            I am currently a 4th year student at the University of Calgary. I major in Software Engineering at
            the Sculich Schoool of Engineering. I first discovered my interest in programming during my first
            year of university. In the first year of engineering, every student must take an intro class for
            every engineering specialization, and when I took the intro programming class, I instantly fell in
            love with it and knew it was what I wanted to do.

          <p>
          For my Software Engineering Capstone Project, my friends and I were able to partner with WestJet to
          create a flight recommendation system for their website. There are three fundamental components to this
          project, the Recommendation Engine for recommending flights, the Tracking Engine to track the
          customer's past flights and the Vue component to display the information. This is currently a work in
          progress. Since this is a sponsored project, the repository for this project is private.
            <ul>
              <li>Developed using <b>JavaScript, Vue, Axios, Hapi</b></li>
