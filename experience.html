                        Calgary,Alberta,Canada<br>
                        September 2017 - June 2022</b><br><br>
                    I am currently a 4th year student at the University of Calgary. I major in Software Engineering at
                    the Sculich Schoool of Engineering. I first discovered my interest in programming during my first
                    year of university. In the first year of engineering, every student must take an intro class for
                    every engineering specialization, and when I took the intro programming class, I instantly fell in
                    love with it and knew it was what I wanted to do.

            <p>
                For my Software Engineering Capstone Project, my friends and I were able to partner with WestJet to
                create a flight recommendation system for their website. There are three fundamental components to this
                project, the Recommendation Engine for recommending the flights, the Tracking Engine to track the
                customer's past flights and the Vue component to display the information. This is currently a work in
                progress.
